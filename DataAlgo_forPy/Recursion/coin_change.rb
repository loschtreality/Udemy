# Given a target amount n and a list (array) of distinct coin values, what's the fewest coins needed to make the change amount.

# For example:
# If n = 10 and coins = [1,5,10]. Then there are 4 possible ways to make change:
# 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
# 5 + 1+1+1+1+1
# 5+5
# 10

# With 1 coin being the minimum amount.
