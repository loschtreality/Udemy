# Given two rectangles, determine if they overlap. The rectangles are defined as a Dictionary, for example:
#
# r1 = {
#
#          # x and y coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the rectangle
#          'x': 2 , 'y': 4,
#
#          # Width and Height of rectangle
#          'w':5,'h':12}
#
#
# If the rectangles do overlap, return the dictionary which describes the overlapping section
# Requirements
# Make sure the dictionary you output is in the same form as the input.
# Feel free to use an IDE for the code, but make sure you use paper/pencil or whiteboard to draw out your plan and logic
