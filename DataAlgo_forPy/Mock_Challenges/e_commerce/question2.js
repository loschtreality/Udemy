// Problem

// Given a list of integers, write a function that will return a list, in which for each index the element will be the product of all the integers except for the element at that index
// For example, an input of [1,2,3,4] would return [24,12,8,6] by performing [2×3×4,1×3×4,1×2×4,1×2×3]

// Requirements

// You can not use division in your answer! Meaning you can't simply multiply all the numbers and then divide by eahc element for each index!
// Try to do this on a white board or with paper/pencil.
